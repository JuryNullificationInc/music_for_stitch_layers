This is my attempt to learn computer music. It is divided into three major sections:

- Musicology: the study of music as psychoacoustic phenomena. How music is constructed, the choices which govern its construction, and the alternatives which constitute the range of possible choices. In other words: this is my attempt to explore the actual problem domain centering around the question, "How do I make something I enjoy listening to?"
- Computer Music: the study of how the innovation of the computer opens new alternatives from which to choose. 
- Abstract Music: the study of how abstractions open new possibilities of intentional choice when constructing music from alternative options.
