This is my attempt to learn computer music. It is divided into four major sections:

- Musicology: the study of music as psychoacoustic phenomena. How music is constructed, the choices which govern its construction, and the alternatives which constitute the range of possible choices. In other words: this is my attempt to explore the actual problem domain centering around the question, "How do I make something I enjoy listening to?"
- Computer Music: the study of how the innovation of the computer opens new alternatives from which to choose. 
- Abstract Music: the study of how abstractions open new possibilities of intentional choice when constructing music from alternative options.
- Mousadelics: a personal study of how I am affected by the manifestations of music, and my reflections on my own musical manifestations.

I am inspired to make music because I love poetry. I want to learn so I can put musical backings to my favorite poems.

# Musicology

I am intentionally choosing to learn musicology via a microtonal-first approach. My first musicology textbook is Kyle Gann's fantastic "The Arithmetic of Listening." I do not consider microtonal frameworks nor just intonation to be "better than" the typical western atonal 12-tone equal temperament (12tet) system. Rather, I consider them to be complementary. 

I have attempted to learn "music theory" a couple times and bounced off it each time. Kyle Gann provides an elucidation of the unseen assumptions built into the framework of what I have tried to learn. Seeing them put into the light gives me a good idea of the range of choices one can make when considering the construction of music.

# Computer Music

I am a programmer. I suck at learning to manipulate physical instruments. Currently my tech stack for producing music is the ChucK programming language. Once I acquire a midi controller, I'll also be using the midish tool. I'm very interested in learning the processes for synthesizing audio.

# Abstract Music

I love mathematics, but have found myself struggling to learn it for want of a problem domain to ground the abstract within. 

# Mousadelics

This is an introspective, cybernetic study of the manifestations of music. I am a positive feedback loop: the music I listen to influences the music I make, and the music I make influences the music I listen to. I am the intermediator, the decision boundary separating the manifestations which emanate from me from the manifestations which impact me. I am the musician, the manifestation of my own musical intentions.
