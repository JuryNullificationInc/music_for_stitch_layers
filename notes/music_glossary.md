# Pitch

A repeating oscillation of air pressure that gives rise to psychoacoustic phenomena. Pitches are measured in hertz and cents.

# Interval

The difference between two pitches.

## Just Intonation

In just intonation, intervals are represented as ratios relative to a fundamental pitch, where the numerator describes how many cycles a pitch attains per cycle of the fundamental.

### Superparticular Intervals

A superparticular interval is one whose numerator is the successor of the denominator, i.e. a ratio of the form (N+1)/N.

## 12TET

The 12-tone equal temperament (12TET) is a system of musical pitch notation in which each pitch is a multiple of 100 cents. 

## Horizontal interval

Difference between two successively-sounded pitches.

## Vertical interval

Difference between two simultaneously-sounded pitches.

## Important Intervals

These are intervals that occur with such frequency (i make a funny) that we give them special names. They are helpful for organizing musical concepts and as methods for intentionally exploring musical configurations.

### Perfect Fifths

#### Just Intonation

A perfect fifth, with respect to a fundamental pitch, is a pitch whose ratio to the fundamental is 3:2 (that is, the fifth cycles three times to every two cycles of the fundamental). A ratio of 3:2 corresponds to a difference of about 702 cents (701.96, rounded to the nearest tenth). 

Note that the perfect fifth is a superparticular interval.

#### 12TET

A perfect fifth, with respect to a fundamental pitch, is a pitch that is 700 cents above the fundamental.

## Perfect Fourths

A perfect fourth has a ratio of 4:3 (wrt the fundmanetal), making it another superparticular interval, and corresponds to about 498 cents.

### Just Intonation

A perfect fourth is a pitch 500 cents above the fundamental.

# Octave

The interval between a pitch and the next pitch with a waveform that is related via some integral power of 2.

# Note

A note is a representation of an equivalence class of pitches, modulo the octave.

## Semitone

In 12 tone equal temperament (the tuning of the common practice era), a semitone is an interval of 100 cents. There are 12 semitones per octave. 

Reframing the previous section on "Important Intervals":

- A perfect fifth is 7 semitones above the fundamental (3 whole steps and a half step).
- A perfect fourth is 5 semitones above the fundamental (2 whole steps and a half step).

# Note Palettes

Note palettes describe the collection of notes which form a composition. Some palettes are, by definition, ordered, and some are not. The ordering of a palette has implications for how chords are constructed on that palette.

## Keys

A key is a collection of notes that divies and spans the octave. It is defined as a conjunction of a root note (or a "tonal center") and a set of intervals.

## Scales 

Scales are keys whose intervals are arranged in standard (ascending) order: the root note is ordered first, then the next nearest interval, and so forth.

## Modes

Modes are keys with a non-standard ordering.

# Chords

A chord is a set of notes that are played simultaneously. Chords are independent of scales; that is, the rules to construct a particular chord are invariant across scale. Given a scale, a chord can be constructed via ordinal position of the notes in the scale.
