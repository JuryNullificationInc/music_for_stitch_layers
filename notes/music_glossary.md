# Pitch

A repeating oscillation of air pressure that gives rise to psychoacoustic phenomena. Pitches are measured in hertz and cents.

# Interval

The difference between two pitches.

## Horizontal interval

Difference between two successively-sounded pitches.

## Vertical interval

Difference between two simultaneously-sounded pitches.

# Octave

The interval between a pitch and the next pitch with a waveform that is related via some integral power of 2.

# Note

A note is a representation of an equivalence class of pitches, modulo the octave.

# Scale

A scale is a collection of notes that divide and span the octave. It is defined as a conjunction of a root note, a set of intervals, and an ordering on those intervals.

# Chords

A chord is a set of notes that are played simultaneously. Chords are independent of scales; that is, the rules to construct a particular chord are invariant across scale. Given a scale, a chord can be constructed via ordinal position of the notes in the scale.
