I was super music averse until about 2016 (age 18) and then had a 3 year Pink Guy phase, then hyperfixated on a couple singles until a friend in college recommended I start listening by the album. He got me into Nujabes, then I spent a year or two intermittently listening to the same three albums (by the doors) until a vendor of garden tomatoes introduced me to Days of Future Passed about two and a half years ago, when I started getting into poetry. Then I listened to it again recently and now I'm really trying to develop my music appreciation. 

I'm primarily a textual creature and want to develop my music tastes in a constructive and methodological way. To help me figure out what I do and do not enjoy, I'll be trying to write a full review for each album I critically listen to. It feels kinda goofy, but I'm enjoying it thus far.
