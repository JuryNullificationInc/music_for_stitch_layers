# Slice The Cake - Odyssey to the West (2016)

**Rating (Extempore, The Exile Part II)**: N/A
**Reason**: Growly vocals and chaotic musical texture shut me out. Not bad, just not for me.

## Wikipedia Info

**Genres**: Prog metal; technical death metal; deathcore; avant-garde metal; spoken word
**Length**: 1:17:17

Simultaneous release with "Odyssey to the Gallows", both being part of the same concept. Interestingly, this album is responsible for the StC disbanding in 2016, only for them to regroup in 2020.

## My Thoughts

The intro to "The Exile Part I - The Razor's Edge" was quite nice. The transition to the guitar and drum solo was quite interesting, like the backdraft of a fire sucking up all the oxygen in the room. The transition from the first song to the next, "The Exile Part II - The City of Destruction" was also interesting: how the first song just ended and went to the spanish guitar section of the next is indeed thematically appropriate, true to the musical theme of the music being on "the razor's edge." 

However, the growly nature of "The City of Destruction" just absolutely loses me. It's not that I dislike it, but the chaos of the musical texture loses me entirely... I feel more like I just can't form an opinion because I'm not feeling it. 

It's not my cup of tea but it does feel like two very well-produced songs that accomplish the artists' visions.

# Miles Davis - Sketches of Spain (1960)

**Ranking (Extempore, Concierto de Aranjuez)**: A+ Tier
**Reason**: Breathtakingly beautiful interliminal transitions, richly structured intraliminals

## Wikipedia Info

**Genres**: Third stream; orchestral jazz; Spanish classical music

"Davis's wife Frances Davis insisted he accompany her to a performance by flamenco dancer Roberto Iglesias. Inspired by the performance, Davis bought every flamenco album he could get at Colony Records shop in New York City." - Wikipedia c.f. Billboard, 26 May 2001, p.68 ["Wife & Muse, Frances Davis Recalls Life with Miles"](https://www.worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Billboard/00s/2001/BB-2001-05-26.pdf)

Totally understandable, this album's about to make me do the same. 

## My Thoughts

**Summary**: It's something old, but also something new. It's something borrowed and beautifully bluesy. I love it.

I especially love the trumpets, which I suppose is appropriate for a Miles Davis album. Aside from that, at a first listening, I can't point out anything in particular I love because of how deeply interconnected everything is. 

### "Concierto de Aranjuez"

My goodness. There is so much to love about every single second. This is being written as I listen to the album, and there's so much more to appreciate than I can even analyze, let alone articulate. About 5 minutes in to the first song is when I was pretty sure I was in love with this album. 

## "Saeta"

From the beginning of the song to a miday point, the trumpet is prominent. There's also a backbeat of stomping and tambourining. The piano tinkles delicately in the background every so often. Then the trumpet gives way and the tambourine comes in, almost triumphantly, taking the center of the lemma until the trumpet comes back in again. So great.
