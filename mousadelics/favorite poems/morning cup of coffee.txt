"That Morning Cup of Coffee" Dwayne Leon Rankin

∅∅∅

Somewhat bitter, somewhat sweet,
    Meant to keep me on my feet.
With a scent to wake me up,
    When its poured there in my cup.
Dark and rich this brew of mine,
    Always tasting mighty fine.
This cup of Jo is truly good
    Tasting always like it should.

T’is very nice here in the morn.
When the day is newly born.

When there’s just a hint of chill
    Then I sit and drink my fill.
Peace and quiet time for me,
    All alone in harmony.
With my cup for me to sip,
    This coffee on my tongue and lip.
